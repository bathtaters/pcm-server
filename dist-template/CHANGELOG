PCM Server Change Log

---------------------------------------------
v2.0.0 - 2/16/23
    Inital public release (v1.0 only functioned with my specific setup)

---------------------------------------------
v2.1.0 - 2/18/23
    Major changes:
        - Allow selecting non-default device
        - Changed how channel count mismatches are handled
            - If channels setting is less than input channels:
                Used to: Fold excess channels into selected channels (See SoX -c option)
                Now: Removes excess channels from the stream
            - If channels setting is greater than input channels:
                Used to: Throw error and exit
                Now: Repeats base channels to fill in excess channels (See SoX -c option)
    Bug fixes:
        - Checks settings on server start (Rather than waiting for a client to connect)
